# 🔥 Real-Time Fire & Smoke Detection with YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time fire, smoke, spark, and flame detection system using a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model**. It uses webcam input and triggers **email alerts** when a fire-like scenario is detected with high confidence — ideal for surveillance, safety monitoring, and smart detection systems.
